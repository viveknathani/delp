# CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES 

All PRs should be made for a `merge` on the `dev` branch. Link your PR with the relevant issue. 

It is important to write good commits. 

## What is good?

1. A good commit message is detailed.
2. It focusses on the *why* more than the *what* or the *how*. What you do is tracked by Git already. How you do it is visible to the reader of your code already.

## Use the editor method to write commits

We are used to writing: 
```bash 
git commit -m "a message"
```
**Avoid that.**

Just run `git commit` and it will open up an editor.
 
To configure your *"default"* editor:
```bash
git config --global core.editor <name>

name could be nano/emacs/vim/whatever you like
```

## Structure of the commit

A good commit message is broken down into three parts:

```
> Top

> Middle

> Bottom
```
with *exactly* one-line spacing vertically between sections.

<br>
 
The *top* should follow the format:
```
<type>: <summary or the subject line> 
```

where *type* is one of:

    feat: The new feature you're adding to a particular application
    fix: A bug fix
    style: Feature and updates related to styling
    refactor: Refactoring a specific section of the codebase
    test: Everything related to testing
    docs: Everything related to documentation
    chore: Regular code maintenance

**The net length of the top should not be more than 50 characters.**

Do not end the subject line with a period.
<br>

The *middle* (or the body):
```
Elaborate your work. Do not assume the reviewer understands what the original problem was, ensure you add it. Do not think your code is self-explanatory.
```

The *bottom* section is optional. Use it if you want to link the commit to an issue.
